			<h1>WE ARE LIVING IN AN OVER-SOCIETY.</h1>
			<p class="maintext">French scholar Jean-Baudrillard pointed out that modern society is "obese in all existing systems". Science, technology, information, culture, and economy are expanding as everything in our society is abundant. It is easy to get what you want anytime, anywhere with the Internet, and media and information as well as material aspects are particularly overflowing. Flood of information, excessive connections between people, flooding of messages. We are living in an over-society now, with no loss of social communication. Overview also means an overview, but if you think about it one by one, it can also be interpreted as an excessive perspective or gaze. This social phenomenon is defined as Over + view and is an archive page for this phenomenon.</p>
